Android FOODY
=================

Modern food recipes application using kotlin coroutines and retrofit2.

Introduction
------------

Kotlin Coroutines: A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously. 
Retrofit: Retrofit is type-safe REST client for Android and Java which aims to make it easier to consume RESTful web services. ... Retrofit automatically serialises the JSON response using a POJO(Plain Old Java Object) which must be defined in advanced for the JSON Structure.

Android FOODY demonstrates utilizing these components to create a simple food recipe app.


In this application user can view recipe, add them in local storage, review them.
There is also filter search, instructions of recipe and overview of the recipes and food joke fragment.
It also support dark android dark theme.


Getting Started
---------------
This project uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
`gradlew build` command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

There are two Gradle tasks for testing the project:
* `connectedAndroidTest` - for running Espresso on a connected device
* `test` - for running unit tests

[Developer Guides](https://developer.android.com/guide/) at

### spoonacular API


FOODY uses the [spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) to load recipes, images, instructions,food type and food joke. To use the API, you will need to obtain a free  API key or open an paid account.

Once you have the key, change the constant `API_KEY` in `Constant.kt` file that can be found in
`~app\src\main\java\com\example\foody\util` path.

```
const val API_KEY = "[Your API_Key]"
```
